Exploratory analysis and machine learning on song audio features to predict popularity scores.

# Can You Predict Song Popularity?

This project explores whether a song’s popularity can be predicted using audio features such as danceability, energy, loudness, tempo, and more.

Using a labeled dataset, we applied:
- **Supervised learning**: linear regression to predict a popularity score
- **Unsupervised learning**: k-means clustering to identify patterns in audio features
- **Exploratory analysis**: correlation heatmaps to examine relationships between features

All analysis and visualizations were conducted in Python using a Jupyter notebook.
